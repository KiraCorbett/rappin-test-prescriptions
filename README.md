# Having Fun with Ruby Refactoring

This a console-based program that outputs Noel Rappin's 54 test prescriptions from the book *Rails 5 Test Prescriptions: Build a Healthy Codebase*. 

To get started, clone this repo into your local computer's project directory by `git clone https://github.com/KiraCorbett/rappin-test-prescriptions.git`

### Practice Ruby Refactoring
This directory provides a sample program that needs some perfume because it is smelly. `cd` into the `code-smell-practice` directory to start working on some "smelly code" that needs refactoring. You can run `ruby main.rb` to see the program output.

### Example Solution
My example semi-solution is found in the `example-solution` directory. Run `ruby run_rappin.rb`.

### Exploration 10
This is my class asignment for Software Engineering II which provides console options to print either all of Rappin's test prescriptions or my assignment response. Run `ruby rappin.rb`.
