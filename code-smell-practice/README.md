# Ruby Refactoring Practice

### Getting Started
1. After cloning this repo, run `ruby main.rb` to see what the program looks like. You should see a welcome message and all 54 Rappin test prescriptions.

2. Notice the code. It has a lot of code smells and a lot of repetitive behavior. For fun, see if you can refactor it. If you get stuck, you can see an example of a semi-solution in the solutions directory. If you figure out a solution, feel free to submit a Pull Request so it can be added to the solution directory. 

3. Make small changes, test, and commit frequently.
